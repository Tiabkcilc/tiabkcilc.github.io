## Professional Self-Assessment
Professional Self-Assessment
Completing the Computer Science program has been a transformative experience that has shaped not only my technical capabilities but also my core professional values. Throughout my coursework, I have developed a deep appreciation for the entire software development lifecycle, learning that true engineering goes beyond writing functional code. It requires an unwavering commitment to efficiency, scalability, and, above all, security. Developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to critically reflect on my growth and synthesize my diverse experiences into a cohesive professional identity: a software engineer who views every architectural decision through a security-first lens.

My technical foundation has been rigorously tested and refined through a variety of academic and practical challenges.

Collaborating in a Team Environment and Communicating with Stakeholders
Effective software engineering is fundamentally collaborative. During the creation of a comprehensive Software Design Document (SDD) for the Travlr Getaways web application, I gained vital experience translating complex technical architectures into clear, actionable requirements for diverse stakeholders. Furthermore, drafting incident analysis briefs for simulated enterprise data breaches taught me how to communicate critical technical risks and mitigation strategies to non-technical management, ensuring alignment between engineering teams and business objectives.

Data Structures and Algorithms
I approach problem-solving with a focus on computational efficiency. Beyond traditional sorting and searching implementations, I have applied advanced algorithmic principles in dynamic scenarios, such as developing a deep Q-learning model to train an intelligent agent to successfully navigate a complex maze. This experience reinforced my ability to select, implement, and optimize the precise algorithmic tools required for highly specialized computing problems.

Software Engineering and Database Management
My software engineering experience spans multiple paradigms and platforms. Developing a mobile application that utilized the Android SensorManager required strict adherence to mobile lifecycle management and robust software design patterns. In the realm of databases, I have learned to prioritize data integrity and normalization, ensuring that backend systems are structurally sound, scalable, and capable of supporting complex relational queries without compromising performance.

Security Mindset
Security is the cornerstone of my professional aspirations. My approach is deeply informed by industry standards, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the core principles of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Designing a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) matrix for a simulated healthcare firm and developing actionable phishing incident response playbooks have instilled in me a proactive security posture. I do not view security as an afterthought; it is an integrated component of every line of code I write and every system I design.

ePortfolio Artifact Summary
The artifacts presented in this portfolio were carefully selected and enhanced to demonstrate a full spectrum of computer science competencies, functioning together to showcase a secure, efficient, and maintainable approach to software development.

Software Design and Engineering: The first artifact is an interactive 3D Still Life Scene built in C++ using OpenGL. I enhanced this project by migrating it from a procedural script to a robust Object-Oriented architecture. This demonstrates my ability to implement complex class hierarchies, manage memory safely using smart pointers, and design scalable, modular software that incorporates user interaction.

Algorithms and Data Structures: The second artifact is an Advising Assistance Course Planner. By replacing standard library sorting functions with a custom-built Binary Search Tree (BST), I optimized the application's data retrieval processes to run in linear time. This highlights my capability to manually engineer complex data structures to solve specific performance bottlenecks.

Databases: The final artifact is a data dashboard backend for an animal shelter. I completely re-architected this system from a flat NoSQL structure to a normalized SQLite relational database. By designing a secure, credential-free local connection and enforcing strict schema rules, this artifact serves as a practical demonstration of my ability to identify vulnerabilities and implement secure, structurally sound database solutions.

Together, these projects reflect my technical versatility and my readiness to contribute to a professional engineering team. I invite you to review these artifacts as a demonstration of my commitment to building software that is not only highly functional but structurally resilient and secure.
